## Game Summaries

### 🎨 Doodle Detective
**One draws. One fakes. Everyone votes.**

A hybrid of Pictionary and Mafia where one player draws a secret prompt, but one player (the Faker) doesn't know what's being drawn. The Faker must blend in by pretending to guess convincingly. After time's up, everyone votes on who the Faker is—but the Faker can still win by guessing the prompt!

**Magic Moment:** When the Faker accidentally guesses correctly, creating hilarious confusion.

### 🏔️ Word Avalanche
**Race against the falling timer!**

A word chain game where players say words starting with the last letter of the previous word—but the category keeps changing! As the "avalanche" speeds up, players have less and less time to think, creating frantic fun.

**Magic Moment:** When someone pulls out an obscure word like "tardigrade" and saves themselves.

---

### 🎭 Bluff Masters
**Write lies that sound like truth!**

Players see a trivia question and write fake answers designed to fool others. The real answer is mixed in, and everyone votes on which is true. Points for guessing right AND for fooling others with your creative bluffs.

**Magic Moment:** When someone accidentally writes the exact correct answer while trying to make something up.

---

### 🔊 Sound Safari
**Communicate with sounds only!**

Voice-based charades where one player makes sounds (animal noises, effects, vocalizations) to get their team to guess words. Travel through themed "zones" (Jungle, Ocean, City, Space) with matching prompts.

**Magic Moment:** When someone successfully communicates "elevator" using only dings and whooshing sounds.

---

### 📚 Story Stacker
**Every sentence adds a twist!**

Collaborative storytelling where each player adds one sentence—but everyone has a SECRET PROMPT they must include (add a celebrity, create a disaster, introduce a talking animal). The resulting stories are wonderfully absurd.

**Magic Moment:** When random prompts combine to create unexpectedly perfect narrative moments.

📄 [Full Concept →](concepts/05-story-stacker.md)

---

### ✏️ Quick Sketch Showdown
**Head-to-head drawing battles!**

Two players draw the same prompt simultaneously without seeing each other's work. Split-screen on TV shows both drawings evolving. Everyone else votes on which better captured the prompt. Skill matters less than creativity!

**Magic Moment:** When a child's simple drawing wins against an adult's detailed attempt.

---

### 🔮 Emoji Enigma
**Think in pictures!**

One player translates a movie title, phrase, or saying into emojis only. Others race to decode it first. Kids often outperform adults because they speak emoji fluently!

**Magic Moment:** When an 8-year-old instantly decodes what adults couldn't figure out.

---

### 🧠 Mind Meld
**Think alike. Win together.**

Two players must give the SAME answer to a question without communicating. "Name a yellow fruit" → both type "banana" → MELD! Tests how well you know each other and creates telepathy-like moments when you sync perfectly.

**Magic Moment:** When partners match on an unexpected, obscure answer—proof they truly get each other.
