# ✏️ Quick Sketch Showdown

> **"Two artists. One prompt. Who drew it better?"**

---

## The Hook

Two players draw the SAME prompt simultaneously—but they can't see each other's work until the reveal! Everyone else watches both drawings evolve in split-screen on the TV and then votes on which one better captured the prompt.

It's not about artistic skill—it's about clever interpretation, speed, and sometimes hilarious failures. When a 7-year-old's stick figure beats Dad's "masterpiece," the room goes wild!
