# 🏔️ Word Avalanche

> **"Chain your words before time runs out!"**

---

## The Hook

A fast-paced word chain game where players race against a falling "avalanche" timer. Each player must say a word that starts with the LAST LETTER of the previous word—but here's the twist: the category changes every few words!

Go from "Animals" to "Foods" to "Places" mid-chain, and watch players stumble hilariously as their brain switches gears. The avalanche speeds up each round, and if you can't think of a word in time... you're buried!

   - Player must adapt mid-chain

4. **The Avalanche**:

## The Magic Moment

**The Impossible Letter Save**

The category is "Animals." The chain goes:
- Tiger → Rabbit → Toucan → **Newt**

Now it's Emma's turn. She needs an animal starting with "T"...

"Tardigrade!" she shouts.

Everyone: "WHAT?! Is that real?!"

Dad: "Wait, those are the microscopic water bears!"

The TV validates it. Emma is a HERO. The 8-year-old just taught the adults a new word.

## Why It's Addictive

2. **Category chaos**: Just when you've got a rhythm, everything changes
