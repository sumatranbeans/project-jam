# 🧠 Mind Meld

> **"Think alike. Win together."**

---

## The Hook

Two players must give the SAME answer to a question—WITHOUT communicating! They're shown a prompt like "Name a yellow fruit" and must independently type their answer. If both type "banana," they MELD and score big!

The magic is watching two people's minds synchronize (or hilariously diverge). When partners perfectly align on an obscure answer, it feels like telepathy. When they're wildly different, it's comedy gold.

## How to Play

### Game Modes

**Mode A: Partnership Pairs**
- Fixed pairs compete against other pairs
- Same two people try to meld each round
- Best for 4-6 players

**Mode B: Rotating Partners**
- Partners change each round
- Everyone pairs with everyone eventually
- Best for 3-5 players

### Round Flow (45 seconds)

1. **Pair Selection (5 sec)**
   - Two players are highlighted as the current pair
   - They must try to answer the same

2. **Prompt Shown (5 sec)**
   - A question appears to everyone
   - Example: "Name a farm animal"

3. **Silent Thinking (10 sec)**
   - Both players type their answer privately
   - NO COMMUNICATION allowed
   - No talking, gesturing, or hints

4. **Lock In**
   - Both must submit before time runs out
   - Auto-submit at deadline if not locked

5. **The Reveal**
   - Both answers shown simultaneously
   - MELD = same answer = points!
   - Different = no points, but often hilarious

### Scoring
| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Perfect Meld (exact match) | +3 |
| Near Meld (very close) | +1 |
| No Meld | 0 |

## The Magic Moment

**The Impossible Meld**

Prompt: "Name something you'd bring to a deserted island"

Everyone expects: water, food, phone, boat...

Mom types: "hammock"
Jake (10) types: "hammock"

MIND MELD!

The room explodes. "HAMMOCK?! Why did you both say hammock?!"

Mom: "Because Jake always wants to nap in one!"
Jake: "Because Mom always says she wants to relax!"

They understood each other so well they synced on an unexpected answer. That's the magic.

---

## Why It's Addictive

1. **Telepathy feeling**: Melds feel like magic
2. **Relationship test**: Reveals how well you know someone
3. **Hilarious misses**: Divergent answers are comedy
4. **Strategy debates**: "We should have both said..."
5. **Rotating pairs**: Fresh dynamics each round
6. **Quick rounds**: Fast pace, high energy

## Strategy Tips

Shown on loading screens:

1. **Think obvious first**: What's the MOST common answer?
2. **Know your partner**: What would THEY think is obvious?
3. **Avoid overthinking**: First instinct is often right
4. **Build a pattern**: If you both keep saying "safe" answers, stick with it
5. **Learn from misses**: "Next time, let's both go classic"

---

## Technical Notes

- Answers compared with fuzzy matching
- "Ice cream" = "icecream" = "ice-cream" = MELD
- Synonyms optionally counted as "Close"
- Timer sync ensures simultaneous reveal
- Celebration animation for melds
- Streak tracker visible on screen

*Mind Meld is pure relationship magic bottled into a game. Those moments when two people independently type the same unexpected answer create genuine connection and joy. It's the game that makes you say, "You get me."*
