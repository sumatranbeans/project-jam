# 🔮 Emoji Enigma

> **"Translate the world into tiny pictures!"**

---

## The Hook

One player sees a movie title, phrase, or famous saying and must translate it into ONLY EMOJIS. Others race to decode the emoji message first!

It's Pictionary meets texting culture—and kids often beat adults because they speak emoji fluently! When someone translates "The Wizard of Oz" as 🧙‍♂️🌪️👠➡️🏠 and the room erupts in understanding, pure magic happens.
