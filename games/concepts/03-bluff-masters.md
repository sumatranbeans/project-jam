# 🎭 Bluff Masters

> **"One truth. Three lies. Can you spot the difference?"**

## The Hook

A trivia game where creativity beats knowledge! One player reads a quirky question, and EVERYONE writes an answer—but only ONE answer is true. The real answer gets mixed in with the fake ones, and players vote on which they think is real.

You score points for:
- Guessing the correct answer
- Fooling others with YOUR fake answer

The best bluffers craft answers that SOUND so real that everyone believes them. It's Balderdash meets family fun!

   - TV displays an interesting trivia question
   - Questions are designed to be obscure but guessable

2. **Bluff Writing (30-45 sec)**

   - Goal: Make it sound believable!
   - The TRUE answer is added to the mix automatically

3. **The Lineup (5 sec)**
   - All answers appear on TV (shuffled, anonymous)
   - Players read through the options

4. **Voting (20 sec)**
   - Everyone votes for which answer they think is TRUE
   - You can't vote for your own bluff

## The Magic Moment

**The Accidental Genius**

Question: "What is the most common bird in the world?"

- Mom writes: "House Sparrow"
- Dad writes: "Pigeon"
- Jake (10) writes: "Red-billed Quelea"
- Emma (8) writes: "Chicken"

The answer is revealed: **Red-billed Quelea**

Everyone: "JAKE KNEW THAT?!"

Jake: "I made it up! I thought it sounded like a real bird!"

He accidentally guessed the correct answer word-for-word. The table erupts.

## Why It's Addictive

1. **Anyone can win**: Knowledge helps, but creativity matters more
2. **Pride in bluffing**: Getting someone to vote for YOUR fake is satisfying
3. **Learn something**: Every question reveals a fun fact
4. **No wrong answers**: Bad guesses become funny moments
5. **The detective game**: Analyzing answers for "tells"
6. **Escalating strategy**: You start learning how others bluff

## Example Round

**Players:** Mom, Dad, Jake (10), Grandma

**Question:** "What is the national animal of Scotland?"

**Bluff Writing Phase:**
- Mom thinks: "Something tough... maybe a stag?"
- Dad thinks: "Isn't Scotland cold? Puffin?"
- Jake thinks: "I'll go wild... dragon?"
- Grandma thinks: "I remember this... unicorn!"

**The Answers Appear:**
A) Red Stag
B) Puffin
C) Dragon
D) Unicorn

**Voting:**
- Mom votes: A (her own was submitted, votes what seems real)
- Dad votes: A (Stag seems legit for Scotland)
- Jake votes: D (Unicorn is so weird it might be true)
- Grandma votes: A (Covering her tracks!)

**The Reveal:**
✅ **D) Unicorn** is correct!

**Points:**
- Jake: +2 (guessed right!)
- Mom: +2 (Dad voted for her "Stag")
- Grandma: 0 (she knew but voted wrong as strategy—backfired!)
- Dad: 0 (no one voted for Puffin, and he guessed wrong)

**Grandma:** "I KNEW it was unicorn! I tried to be sneaky!"

**Everyone laughs.**
