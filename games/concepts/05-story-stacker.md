## The Hook

Collaborative storytelling where each player adds ONE sentence to build an absurd, hilarious story—but here's the twist: everyone gets SECRET PROMPT CARDS that they MUST include in their sentence!

One player might need to "add a celebrity," another must "create a disaster," and someone has to "introduce a talking animal." The resulting stories are wonderfully chaotic, and voting on the funniest story segment makes everyone a critic AND a creator.

**The Accidental Masterpiece**

The story so far:
> "Once upon a time, there was a detective named Susan who only solved crimes on Tuesdays."

Dad's secret prompt: **"Add a natural disaster"**
He writes: "Suddenly, a tornado made entirely of spaghetti destroyed the evidence warehouse."

Emma's secret prompt: **"Someone falls in love"**
She adds: "The tornado fell in love with a hurricane named Harold."

The room is crying with laughter. The spaghetti tornado falling in love was NOT planned, but it's now the greatest story ever told in this household.
