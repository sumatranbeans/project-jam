# 🎨 Doodle Detective

> **"Draw, deduce, and discover the faker!"**

## The Hook

Pictionary meets Mafia! One player draws a secret prompt while others guess—but there's a twist: one player is the **Faker** who doesn't know what's being drawn and must blend in by pretending to guess along. After time's up, everyone votes on who the Faker is. The Faker wins if they stay hidden AND correctly guess what the prompt was!

This creates hilarious moments where players are:
- Trying to guess the drawing
- Watching each other's reactions for suspicious behavior
- The Faker desperately trying to piece together clues from others' guesses

## How to Play

### Setup (15 seconds)
1. All players join via QR code
2. Game randomly assigns roles:
   - **1 Artist** (draws the prompt)
   - **1 Faker** (doesn't know the prompt)
   - **Everyone else** (knows the prompt, guesses to help the Artist)

### Round Flow (2-3 minutes)
1. **Drawing Phase (60 seconds)**
   - Artist draws the secret prompt
   - All players (except Faker) see what the prompt is
   - Everyone submits guesses to seem like they're trying to help
   - Faker must guess convincingly without knowing the answer

2. **Voting Phase (30 seconds)**
   - TV shows all players' avatars
   - Everyone votes on who they think the Faker is
   - Majority vote reveals the accused player

3. **Faker's Last Chance**
   - If caught, the Faker gets ONE guess at what the prompt was
   - If they guess correctly, they still win!

### Scoring
| Outcome | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Faker not caught | Faker: +3, Others: 0 |
| Faker caught, guesses wrong | Catchers: +2 each |
| Faker caught, guesses right | Faker: +2, Catchers: +1 |
| Artist's drawing guessed | Artist: +1 |

**Minimum players:** 3
**Optimal players:** 4-5
**Maximum players:** 6

## What You'll Learn

### For Kids (6-10)
- **Observation skills**: Watching others' reactions and behavior
- **Drawing under pressure**: Quick visual communication
- **Social reading**: Detecting when someone seems uncertain
- **Vocabulary**: Learning new words through prompts

### For Everyone
- **Deductive reasoning**: Piecing together clues to find the Faker
- **Bluffing**: The Faker learns to act confidently despite uncertainty
- **Risk assessment**: Is it worth accusing someone?
- **Communication**: Guessing in ways that help the Artist without being too obvious

---

## The Magic Moment

**The Faker's Accidental Genius Guess**

Picture this: The prompt is "ASTRONAUT." The Faker, completely lost, hears someone guess "spaceman?" and another say "helmet?" They panic and shout "SPACE MAN WITH HAT!"—which is SO close that everyone thinks they knew all along.

The voting phase erupts: "Wait, they guessed it right away!" / "No, that was TOO specific, they must have known!" / "But they said HAT not HELMET..."

The social chaos of trying to figure out if someone is faking their confusion vs. genuinely confused is GOLD.

---

## Why It's Addictive

1. **Role variety**: Being the Faker is thrilling; being the Detective is satisfying
2. **Paranoia**: "Why did they guess THAT? Do they know or are they faking?"
3. **Redemption**: The Faker's last-chance guess creates drama
4. **Drawing comedy**: Terrible drawings make identifying the Faker harder—everyone is confused!
5. **Accusation drama**: Pointing fingers at each other is inherently fun
6. **Skill ceiling**: You get better at both faking AND detecting over time

## Example Round

**Players:** Mom (Artist), Dad, Emma (8), Jake (10), Grandma (Faker)

**Prompt:** 🎸 GUITAR

1. **Drawing Phase**
   - Mom starts drawing... a weird shape with strings?
   - Dad guesses: "violin?" (He knows it's guitar, strategic misdirect)
   - Emma guesses: "music thing!" (She knows)
   - Jake guesses: "banjo?" (Strategic)
   - Grandma guesses: "uhhh... piano?" (She has NO idea, panicking)

2. **The Tension Builds**
   - Mom adds more details—clearly has strings and a neck
   - Grandma sees others focusing on strings: "violin?" (copying Dad)
   - Jake notices Grandma's delayed response: 🤔

3. **Voting Phase**
   - Dad votes Grandma (her piano guess was suspicious)
   - Emma votes Jake (she thought his confidence was fake)
   - Jake votes Grandma (the delayed copying)
   - Grandma votes Emma ("I'll blend in by voting randomly!")

4. **The Reveal**
   - Grandma is accused! She's revealed as the Faker!
   - **Grandma's last chance:** "Was it... a guitar?"
   - SHE'S RIGHT! She pieced it together from the later guesses!

5. **Scores**
   - Grandma: +2 (caught but guessed correctly)
   - Dad, Jake: +1 each (caught her, but she still got points)
   - Emma: 0 (voted wrong)
   - Mom: +1 (drawing was eventually clear)

**Everyone:** "ONE MORE ROUND!"
