# 🎼 Project Jam: The Master PRD (v4.1)

> **Powered by Frontier AI**
> 
> 🟠 **Claude Opus 4.5** (`claude-opus-4-5-20251101`) — Anthropic's most intelligent model
> 🔵 **Gemini 3 Pro** (`gemini-3-pro-preview`) — Google's most advanced reasoning model
> ⚡ **Gemini 3 Flash** (`gemini-3-flash-preview`) — Google's fastest production model
> 🟣 **Claude Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — Anthropic's speed-optimized model

**Status:** Wave 1 Complete ✅ | Wave 2 Active 🔄

**Vision:** A cloud-native, hierarchical AI engineering department that pairs frontier intelligence with a lean, automated infrastructure to enable "vibe-coding" at scale.

**Foundational Goal:** To eliminate the manual "copy-paste" friction and hallucination loops of modern AI coding, allowing production-ready apps to be shipped from any device (even a 16GB Air) without local CPU load.

## 🏛️ I. The Founding Five

| Role | Model | Icon | Core Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **You (Director)** | Human | 👤 | Sets tech strategy, high-level intent, and grants final "Green Light". |
| **Product Architect** | 🔵 Gemini 3 Pro | 🔵 | The Architectural Oracle. Uses **2M+ token memory** to ensure global consistency and customer advocacy. |
| **Engineering Lead** | 🟠 Claude Opus 4.5 | 🟠 | **The Builder.** Owns the code, the E2B sandbox, and the active `tasks.md` ledger. |
| **MLOps Engineer** | ⚡ Gemini 3 Flash | ⚡ | Adversarial QC. Runs builds/evals and serves as the primary detector for "Fix Loops". *(Coming soon)* |
| **Program Manager** | 🟣 Claude Haiku 4.5 | 🟣 | The Glue. Manages GitOps, the Master Tracker, and Director briefings. *(Coming soon)* |

## ⚙️ II. System Architecture & Dynamics

### The Recursive Feedback Loop
```
You (Director)
    ↓ Intent
Product Architect (Gemini 3 Pro)
    ↓ Technical Spec / Review
Engineering Lead (Claude Opus 4.5)
    ↓ Code + Execute in E2B
MLOps Engineer (Gemini 3 Flash)
    ↓ Test + Validate (Coming soon)
Program Manager (Claude Haiku 4.5)
    ↓ Commit to GitHub (Coming soon)
```

### Current Flow (Wave 2)
```
You (Director)
    ↓ Intent
Engineering Lead (Claude Opus 4.5)
    ↓ Code Plan
Product Architect (Gemini 3 Pro)
    ↓ Review + Approve/Veto
E2B Sandbox
    ↓ Execute
GitHub
    ↓ Commit
```

### Veto & Debate Logic

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Single Error** | Product Architect flags concern, Engineering Lead fixes |
| **Repeated Error (2x)** | Veto triggered, strategic pivot required |
| **Fix Loop Detected** | Process halted, Director intervention requested |
| **No Consensus (3 turns)** | UI presents: `[Accept Engineer's Path]` or `[Accept Architect's Path]` |

---

## 🛠️ III. Technical Stack

| Component | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Optimized for Vercel deployment and real-time streaming. |
| **Sandbox** | E2B (Excelsior) | Full Ubuntu cloud environment; 0% local CPU load. |
| **Version Control** | GitHub Engine | Automated repo creation and "Push-on-Pass" logic. |
| **Builder** | 🟠 Claude Opus 4.5 | #1 on WebDev Arena. Unmatched code generation. |
| **Supervisor** | 🔵 Gemini 3 Pro | 2M context window. Best architectural reasoning. |
| **Tester** | ⚡ Gemini 3 Flash | Fast adversarial testing. Loop detection. *(Coming soon)* |
| **Ops** | 🟣 Claude Haiku 4.5 | Efficient GitOps and status updates. *(Coming soon)* |
| **Efficiency** | Prompt Caching | Reduces repeat-prompt costs by up to 90%. |
| **Security** | Upstash + Clerk | BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) transparency. |

## 🚦 IV. Guardrails & Constants

1. **`tasks.md` Source of Truth** — The Engineering Lead maintains this as the active ledger.
2. **No Duplicate Logic** — Agents must reuse or refactor existing code, never duplicate.
3. **JSON-Only Handshakes** — All agent communication must be valid JSON.
4. **95% Approval Rule** — Product Architect approves "good enough" code; minor notes logged as concerns.
5. **Loop Detection** — 2+ failed attempts at the same bug triggers a strategic pivot.

### 🚦 Director's Final Note

We are building for **Quality over Quantity**. This is not another chat-with-code tool. This is a **Self-Operating Engineering Department** powered by the world's most advanced AI models.

**Engineering Lead (Claude):** You are the steward of this vision. Maintain `tasks.md`. Follow the handshakes. Ship quality. 🎸
