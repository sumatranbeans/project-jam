You're right. Let me create a comprehensive `tasks.md` that includes all 58 features with their strategic reasoning.

In Codespace, create `tasks.md` in the root folder and paste:

```markdown
# Project Jam - Master Task Tracker

> Engineering Lead: Claude | Product Lead: Gemini | Director: User
> Last updated: Dec 27, 2025

## 🎯 TODAY'S MISSION: Wave 2 - The Agent Handshake

```
User Intent → Claude (Builder) → Gemini (Supervisor) → E2B Execute → GitHub Commit

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE REFERENCE

**The Trinity:**
- **Builder (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):** Senior Engineer — writes code, executes commands
- **Supervisor (Gemini 1.5 Pro):** Principal Architect — reviews, vetoes, corrects
- **Director (User):** Product Owner — sets intent, approves

**The Loop:**
```
Director Intent
    → Builder generates code/commands
    → Supervisor audits (pass/veto)
    → E2B executes
    → Auto-commit to GitHub
    → Vercel deploys
```
